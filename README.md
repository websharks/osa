## OSA libraries for Mac JXA

This repo contains OSA libraries for JavaScript for Automation (JXA) scripting on a Mac. This library may be helpful to others as it provides many examples of real-world use of JXA. However, it is specifically designed for use by WebSharks, Inc. Therefore, as-is, it is not likely to function for anyone outside of our organization.

### Homebrew installation package coming soon...

## Installation Instructions:

```bash
$ brew install ????
```
