## OSA libraries for Mac JXA

This repo contains OSA libraries for JavaScript for Automation (JXA) scripting on a Mac. This library may be helpful to others as it provides many examples of real-world use of JXA. However, it is specifically designed for use by WebSharks, Inc. Therefore, as-is, it is not likely to function for anyone outside of our organization.

### Installation Instructions

```bash
$ brew tap websharks/formulas
$ brew install websharks-osa
```

### Upgrading To Latest Version

```bash
$brew upgrade websharks-osa
```
